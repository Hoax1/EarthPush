# EarthPush
EarthPush is a powerful earthbending technique that can be used both offensively and defensively. It's main use is to raise a wall or pillar from the ground to block incomming attacks. The wall/pillar can then be pushed along the ground, knocking away and dealing damage to everything in it's path. EarthPush can also be used for mobility by launching it towards yourself. Be careful though, it deals a lot of damage!
